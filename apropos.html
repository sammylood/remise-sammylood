                        <p>Leo Fender wanted to craft an instrument that was as functional as it was easy to use. It was a primitive-looking object that was tough as nails, its powerful name inspired by another groundbreaking invention: the television. And with its revolutionary electrified tone, it would change the way music was made—forever. When someone asks, “Why Fender electrics?” the answer is clear. Fender guitars were designed to be louder, and exciting tones they produced are still engrained into our cultural DNA.</p>

                        <h2>THE FIRST WORD IN ELECTRIC BASS</h2>
                        <p>In 1951, we wanted to liberate musicians from the confines of the upright bass. And we did it by introducing a brand-new instrument with a bold, new sound. That instrument was the Precision Bass®, a name that would not only become synonymous with rock ‘n’ roll, but also shape its very being. As time went on, we created new instruments to cater to a new, evolving type of musician: the electric bassist. Each one was and still is a driving force behind the greatest moment in music—of every era, of every genre. Period.</p>
